Currently, there are two independent user interfaces: checkout and
work order.  The URL of the shop checkout user interface is the URL of
the directory containing the shop app.  The URL of the work order interface
is the same with "workorder" appended.  It is assumed that the web
server is configured to use index.php as a directory index.

Example URLs:

https://example.wisc.edu/example_shop
https://example.wisc.edu/example_shop/workorder

The administrative interface uses the same URL as the normal user
interface.  Administrative users are flagged as admins by having an
administrator edit their user profile and check the admin box.  The
first admin has to be set as an admin by editing their record in the
database.
