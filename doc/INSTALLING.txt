This web app requires Apache, PHP, MySQL/Mariadb, and periodic running
of scripts via cron or equivalent.  It has only been tested in Linux.
The following versions of things have been observed to work:

Debian Linux 11
Apache 2.4.56
PHP 7.4
MariaDB 10.5.19

Installation steps:

1. Clone the git repo into a directory served by the web server and
   rename it as desired.

git clone https://github.com/dcbradley/shop.git
mv shop example_shop
cd example_shop

2. If desired, check out a specific version.  Example:

git checkout v1.0

   To see the available version tags use the command 'git tag'.

3. Install PHP dependencies.

php composer.phar update

4. Create a directory with appropriate permissions to allow the web
   server to store uploaded files.  No other directories should be
   writable by the web server.

mkdir img uploads
sudo chown www-data:www-data img uploads

5. Configure the web directory to require shibboleth or alternate
   authentication.  If shibboleth is configured to provide the user's
   name and email address, the app will make use of it.  It expects
   them to be available via the attributes 'givenName', 'sn',
   'wiscEduMSOLPrimaryAddress', and/or 'mail'.

cp htaccess-example .htaccess

6. Disable web access to the .git directory:

cp scripts/.htaccess .git/.htaccess

7. Create a config file and edit it:

cp config-example.php config.php

8. Create a database connection file and edit it:

cp db-example.php db.php

9. Create a database matching the database name you configured in db.php.

mysql> CREATE DATABASE example_shop default charset utf8;

10. Create a database user matching the name and password configured in db.php.

mysql> CREATE USER 'example_shop'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'example-password';
mysql> GRANT ALL ON example_shop.* TO 'example_shop'@'localhost';

11. Initialize the database.  This must be repeated any time you
    change the customized column names in config.php
    (e.g. SHOP_ADMIN_COL).  The reason there are customizable column
    names is to allow for multiple shops sharing the same user
    database to have an independent set of admins and so on.

php scripts/update_database_schema.php

12. Log in to the app via a web browser.  This will create a record
    for you in the user table.

13. Make your account an admin user.  Once you are an admin, you can
    empower other admins through the web interface rather than using
    the database to do it.

mysql> UPDATE user WHERE NETID = 'example' SET SHOP_ADMIN = 1;

14. Set up cron jobs if desired.  These can run as the web server user
    (e.g. www-data).  Example:

13 10 * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/example_shop/scripts/overdue_notices.php
25 5 1 * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/example_shop/scripts/bill_last_month.php

15. Make sure the database is backed up regularly, for example with
    automysqlbackup plus some other backup service.

16. If desired, import part definitions from a CSV file.  The script
    scripts/import_parts.php may help.  Similarly, import_vendors.php
    may be used to import vendors.  Otherwise, all data can be entered
    through the administrative interface.

17. If the web interface is being run in a kiosk, it can make things
    behave more predictably to have the browser restart after each
    session.  One way to achieve this is to have a script listen on
    localhost port 9999 and restart the browser when it receives a
    connection.  The web app will connect to port 9999 when the user
    logs out if the app was loaded with query parameter 'kiosk'.
    Example: https://example.wisc.edu/example_shop?kiosk
    An example of a script that runs and restarts the web browser
    is in scripts/launch_browser.py.
